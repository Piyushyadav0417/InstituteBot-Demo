## InstituteBot Demo ðŸŽ“

This is a demo of an **AI-powered assistant for educational institutes**.  
The bot integrates **OpenAI GPT-4** with **Django models** (`Course`, `Trainer`, `About`) using **LangChain agents**.  
It allows students to ask natural language questions like:  

- "Who teaches the Python course?"  
- "What is the duration of the Data Science course?"  
- "Show me all beginner-level courses."  
- "Give me Ravi Kumarâ€™s LinkedIn profile."  

Behind the scenes, the agent safely generates **Django ORM queries** and executes them, returning precise answers.  

Key Features:
- âœ… Safe execution of ORM queries (no raw SQL or unsafe eval)  
- âœ… Conversational memory to handle multi-turn Q&A  
- âœ… GPT-4 powered natural language understanding  
- âœ… Built with LangChainâ€™s Conversational React Agent  
- âœ… Extendable for any institute/edtech platform
